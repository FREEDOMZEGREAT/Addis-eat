# Authentication

Addis Eats supports Google OAuth through NextAuth and a separate demo email/password form. Both flows create the app's custom `session` cookie; the app uses that cookie for authorization on protected pages and order operations.

## Local setup

Create `.env.local` in the project root and set these variables. Keep the file private and never commit real credentials.

```dotenv
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=your-google-oauth-client-id
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=your-google-oauth-client-secret
AUTH_SECRET=replace-with-a-random-secret
SESSION_SECRET=replace-with-a-random-secret-of-at-least-32-characters
# Required on Vercel; create a Neon Postgres database and use its pooled connection string
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/database?sslmode=require
DEMO_CUSTOMER_EMAIL=customer@example.com
DEMO_CUSTOMER_PASSWORD=choose-a-local-demo-password
DEMO_STAFF_EMAIL=staff@example.com
DEMO_STAFF_PASSWORD=choose-a-local-demo-password
# Optional additional credential accounts (JSON array; roles: customer or staff)
DEMO_USERS_JSON='[{"email":"another.customer@example.com","password":"choose-a-password","role":"customer"},{"email":"another.staff@example.com","password":"choose-a-password","role":"staff"}]'
# Optional comma-separated Google accounts granted the staff role
DEMO_STAFF_EMAILS=staff-two@example.com,staff-three@example.com
```

Configure this authorized redirect URI in the Google OAuth client:

```text
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
```

No external database is required for local development. Start the app with `npm run dev` and open `/signin`. From there, new customers can follow **Create an account**; signup returns to the requested local path, including `/checkout`. New accounts are customer-only, emails are unique and normalized, and passwords of 6-128 characters are scrypt-hashed before storage in the ignored local `data/users.json` file. In production, set `DATABASE_URL` to a Neon Postgres connection string; the account table is created automatically and used for signup and email/password sign-in. Existing credential accounts continue to work.

Any Google account that provides an email can sign in. Google users default to the `customer` role; addresses matching `DEMO_STAFF_EMAIL` or any entry in `DEMO_STAFF_EMAILS` receive the `staff` role. Email/password sign-in accepts the two legacy accounts (`DEMO_CUSTOMER_*` and `DEMO_STAFF_*`), locally registered accounts, plus optional accounts in `DEMO_USERS_JSON`. Each JSON account needs a unique email, password, and either the `customer` or `staff` role. Restart the development server after changing `.env.local`.

The `staff` role can access both `/kitchen` and `/admin`. Give staff access only to people you trust. These environment-configured accounts are for the teaching demo; use a persistent user store and proper password hashing for a real multi-user service.

## App session and access rules

After Google OAuth or account signup succeeds, `src/auth.js` or `src/app/auth-actions.js` creates the app session. The cookie is named `session`, lasts seven days, is `httpOnly`, uses `sameSite=lax`, and is marked `secure` in production. `SESSION_SECRET` must be at least 32 characters. NextAuth uses `AUTH_SECRET` for its provider flow.

| Route or operation                           | Security layers                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/checkout`, `/orders`, `/kitchen`, `/admin` | `src/proxy.js` verifies the signed session cookie before routing. Unauthenticated requests go to `/signin`; kitchen/admin require staff at the proxy.                                             |
| `/orders`, `/kitchen`, `/admin` pages        | Each server page independently reads the app session. Orders query only the current session user ID; kitchen/admin pages also check the staff role.                                               |
| `/track/[id]` page                           | Not part of the proxy matcher. The server page reads the app session, redirects anonymous visitors to sign-in, and returns `notFound()` unless the caller is staff or the order owner.            |
| `placeOrder`, `cancelOrder` server actions   | Each action re-reads the app session. Placement validates the payload and recomputes prices server-side; cancellation checks the order owner before mutation.                                     |
| `setOrderStatus`, `saveMenuItem`, `deleteMenuItem`, `setMenuItemAvailability` server actions | Each action re-reads the app session and requires the `staff` role before mutating orders or the menu.                             |
| `signUp` server action                       | Validates name/email/password, assigns only the `customer` role, scrypt-hashes passwords, and persists accounts in Neon Postgres in production or the local ignored user file during development. |
| `/api/orders`                                | Each method verifies the app session; reads are scoped to its user ID and writes are validated server-side.                                                                                       |
| `/api/orders/[id]`                           | Verifies the app session and returns an order only if its `userId` matches the session user.                                                                                                      |
| `/api/track/[id]`                            | Verifies the app session and returns the tracking payload only if the caller is staff or the order owner; otherwise it responds `404`.                                                            |
| Sign-in/sign-out server actions              | Sign-in validates configured credentials before creating a signed app session and sanitizes `next`; sign-out deletes the app session cookie.                                                      |
| Sign-in redirects                            | `safeRedirectPath` rejects external, protocol-relative, and backslash-containing destinations before redirecting.                                                                                 |

The proxy is an early gate, not the sole authorization check. The signed `session` cookie is the authorization source; a browser-provided identity or NextAuth provider session alone does not grant app-route access.

Google sign-in normally returns users to `/orders`, or to a valid `next` path when one was requested. Configure the staff Google address as `DEMO_STAFF_EMAIL` to grant kitchen access.

## Security attack tests

1. **Forged session / role escalation:** Change a signed cookie's payload or role to `staff` without a valid HMAC, then request `/admin`, `/kitchen`, and `/api/orders`. Expect protected pages to redirect/deny access and the API to return `401`; changing the role claim must not grant staff access.
2. **Order IDOR:** Sign in as customer A, then request `/api/orders/<customer-B-order-id>` and invoke cancellation with that ID. Expect the detail API to return `404`, cancellation to fail, and customer B's order status to remain unchanged.
3. **Tracking IDOR:** Sign in as customer A and request `/track/<customer-B-order-id>` and `/api/track/<customer-B-order-id>`. Expect the page to render `notFound()` and the API to return `404`, so customer B's address and route are never exposed.
4. **Open redirect:** Sign in with `next=https://attacker.example`, `next=//attacker.example`, and a backslash-based destination such as `next=/\\attacker.example`. Try both credential and Google sign-in. Expect every redirect to remain on an allowed local path.

## Manual verification

1. Visit `/checkout` in a private window and confirm it redirects to sign-in. Complete Google sign-in and confirm the app returns to checkout with an active app session.
2. Sign in with an ordinary Google account and confirm `/orders` loads and shows that account's email.
3. Create a fresh account at `/signup`; confirm it becomes a customer, can submit an order, and can only read its own order history. Duplicate email registration should be rejected.
4. Set `DEMO_STAFF_EMAILS` to two Google accounts you control, restart the app, and confirm both can open `/kitchen` and `/admin`.
5. Sign in as a customer and request `/kitchen`; access must be denied by both the proxy and the server-rendered page.
6. Sign out and request `/api/orders`; it should return `401`. Signed-in order reads must only expose orders owned by that session user.
7. Try `/signin?next=https://example.com`; after sign-in, the app must stay on a local route.
8. As staff, set an order to `delivering` in `/admin` and confirm `/track/[id]` shows the road route with a moving courier; then sign in as a different customer and confirm the same URL returns a not-found page.

## Demo limitations

For Vercel, create a Neon Postgres database, copy its pooled connection string into the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in **Project Settings > Environment Variables**, then redeploy. Set it for every environment where signup should work (Production and, if used, Preview). The account table is created automatically on the first account lookup or signup.

Demo credentials and secrets are environment-configured. Registered accounts persist locally in `data/users.json` during development and use Neon Postgres in production. Orders are persisted to Neon Postgres through `src/lib/orders.js` in production and kept in memory during local development. Signup does not yet include email verification, password reset, or rate limiting; configure persistent production storage and abuse protection before exposing it publicly.
